This game chooses one random word from over 7000 wordbase and 
your mission is to guess the word by entering one letter at a time, 
but you have 10 lives (you can change that) and if you know the word,
you can enter whole word and you'll WIN. 

I'll not answer quetion "how do you have 7000 wordbase"...

You can't enter digits. There are words with "-" so... it's hard
